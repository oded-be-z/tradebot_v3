## Agent 2 Progress - 2025-07-23

### Fixes Applied:
1. processQuery() - Added symbols to return ✓
   - Added symbolsUsed to finalResult object
   - Preserving all symbol sources in return
   
2. synthesizeResponse() - Preserved symbols in finalResult ✓  
   - Changed to use understanding.symbols instead of result.symbols
   
3. server.js - Included symbols in response object ✓
   - Extracting symbols from all possible sources
   - Always including symbols array in response

### Test Results:
bitcoin vs gold returned symbols: **NOT WORKING - symbols array missing from response**

### Issue Found:
- Symbols are being extracted correctly (BTC, GOLD or AAPL, MSFT)
- Azure understanding includes symbols array
- But symbols array is NOT in final API response
- Only single 'symbol' field is present

### Next Steps:
Need to debug why symbols array is being dropped between orchestrator and final response.
