# Comparison Chart Fix Summary

## Issue
When users asked for comparisons like "bitcoin vs gold" or "compare X to Y", the system only showed a chart for the first symbol instead of a proper comparison chart with both symbols.

## Root Cause
The orchestrator was passing all symbols correctly, but server.js was only using the first symbol for chart generation, even for comparison queries.

## Changes Made

### 1. **services/dualLLMOrchestrator.js**
- Updated `synthesizeResponse` method to include all symbols in the response:
  ```javascript
  symbols: understanding.symbols || [], // Include all symbols for comparison
  ```
- Updated `processQuery` method to pass symbols from synthesis result:
  ```javascript
  symbols: synthesisResult.symbols || enhancedUnderstanding.symbols || [],
  ```

### 2. **server.js** (lines 3288-3315)
- Added logic to detect comparison queries and use the appropriate chart method:
  ```javascript
  // CHART FIX: Generate chart data if needed
  if (response.showChart && (response.symbols?.length > 0 || response.symbol)) {
    const symbols = response.symbols || [response.symbol];
    const isComparison = orchestratorResult.understanding?.intent === 'comparison_query' && symbols.length > 1;
    
    if (isComparison) {
      logger.info(`[Chart Fix] Generating COMPARISON chart for ${symbols.join(' vs ')}`);
      chartResult = await chartGenerator.generateComparisonChart(symbols);
    } else {
      logger.info(`[Chart Fix] Generating single chart for ${symbols[0]}`);
      chartResult = await chartGenerator.generateSmartChart(symbols[0], "trend");
    }
  }
  ```
- Added symbols field to response object:
  ```javascript
  symbols: orchestratorResult.symbols || orchestratorResult.understanding?.symbols || [],
  ```

### 3. **services/chartGenerator.js**
- The `generateComparisonChart` method already existed and was properly implemented
- It fetches historical data for all symbols and creates a percentage-based comparison chart

## How It Works Now

1. User asks: "bitcoin vs gold"
2. Azure OpenAI understands this as a comparison_query with symbols: ['BTC', 'GOLD']
3. DualLLMOrchestrator passes both symbols through the pipeline
4. Server.js detects it's a comparison query with multiple symbols
5. Server.js calls `chartGenerator.generateComparisonChart(['BTC', 'GOLD'])`
6. Chart shows both lines with percentage change normalization for fair comparison

## Testing
Created `test_comparison_charts.js` to verify:
- Direct comparisons: "bitcoin vs gold"
- Compare commands: "compare tesla to apple"
- Question format: "oil vs silver?"
- Context-based: "compare it to gold" (after discussing Bitcoin)

## To Start Testing
Run the server with:
```bash
npm start
# or
node server.js
```

Then run the test:
```bash
node test_comparison_charts.js
```
