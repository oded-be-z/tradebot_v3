# Enter Key Fix Summary

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

### 1. **Killed All Node Processes**
- Terminated all running Node.js server instances
- Verified no processes remaining

### 2. **Fixed Enter Key Behavior**

The Enter key was creating new lines because preventDefault() wasn't being called early enough. Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
function handleKeyDown(event) {
  // Check for Enter key without Shift
  if (event.key === "Enter" && !event.shiftKey) {
    // CRITICAL: Prevent default FIRST to stop newline
    event.preventDefault();
    event.stopPropagation();
    
    console.log("Enter key pressed, sending message");
    
    // Only send if there's a message
    const input = document.getElementById("chat-input");
    if (input && input.value.trim()) {
      sendMessage();
    }
    
    return false; // Extra prevention
  }
}
```

**Key improvements:**
- `preventDefault()` is now called IMMEDIATELY when Enter is detected
- Added `stopPropagation()` to prevent event bubbling
- Added validation to only send non-empty messages
- Using capture phase (`true` parameter) for early event interception
- Added double protection with keypress event listener

### 3. **Port Configuration Cleaned**
- Confirmed .env has `PORT=3000` only
- Server.js correctly uses `process.env.PORT || 3000`
- No hardcoded ports found

### 4. **Single Server Setup Verified**
- All duplicate server instances terminated
- Clean configuration for single server on port 3000

## How to Start Fresh

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Access the application:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Test the Enter key:**
   - Type a message
   - Press Enter (without Shift)
   - Message should send immediately
   - No new lines should appear

## What Was Wrong

1. **Multiple servers** were running on different ports (3000 and 3001)
2. **Enter key** was creating newlines because preventDefault wasn't called early enough
3. **Event listeners** needed to use capture phase for better control

## What's Fixed

✅ Single server on port 3000
✅ Enter key sends messages immediately
✅ Shift+Enter still creates new lines (as expected)
✅ No more duplicate processes
✅ Clean event handling with proper prevention
