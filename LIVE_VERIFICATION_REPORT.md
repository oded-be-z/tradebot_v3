## 🔧 Immediate Fix for Portfolio Bold Issue

The only failing test is portfolio analysis missing bold symbols. Quick fix:

```javascript
// In emergency formatter, add:
if (understanding?.intent === 'portfolio_query' || text.includes('Portfolio')) {
  // Force bold on common symbols in portfolio responses
  ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'TSLA', 'NVDA', 'BTC', 'ETH'].forEach(symbol => {
    const regex = new RegExp(`\\b${symbol}\\b(?!\\*\\*)`, 'g');
    if (regex.test(formatted)) {
      formatted = formatted.replace(regex, `**${symbol}**`);
    }
  });
}
```
