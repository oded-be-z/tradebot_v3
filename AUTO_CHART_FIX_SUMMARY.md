# Auto-Chart Logic Fix Summary

## Issue
Users asking simple queries like "bitcoin?" or "AAPL price" were getting text responses but NO chart automatically. They had to explicitly ask for "chart" separately.

## Root Cause
The `showChart` logic was too restrictive and relied only on Azure's decision, not considering the query intent properly.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Intelligent Auto-Chart Logic** (services/dualLLMOrchestrator.js, lines 502-527)
Added smart logic to automatically show charts for:
- Price queries (`price_query` intent)
- Trend queries (`trend_query` intent)
- Comparison queries (`comparison_query` intent)
- Analysis queries (`analysis_query` intent)
- Investment advice with symbols
- Any query with symbols that includes keywords: price, trend, how, doing, performance, show
- Single word queries with "?" (like "bitcoin?", "AAPL?")

```javascript
const shouldAutoChart = 
  understanding.intent === 'price_query' ||
  understanding.intent === 'trend_query' ||
  understanding.intent === 'comparison_query' ||
  understanding.intent === 'analysis_query' ||
  understanding.intent === 'investment_advice' ||
  (understanding.symbols?.length > 0 && (
    originalQuery.toLowerCase().includes('price') ||
    originalQuery.toLowerCase().includes('trend') ||
    originalQuery.toLowerCase().includes('how') ||
    originalQuery.toLowerCase().includes('doing') ||
    originalQuery.toLowerCase().includes('performance') ||
    originalQuery.toLowerCase().includes('show') ||
    originalQuery.match(/^[A-Za-z]+\?$/) // Single word with question mark
  ));
```

### 2. **Enhanced Azure Synthesis Prompt** (lines 439-451)
Added explicit chart display rules to the Azure prompt:
- Price queries: ALWAYS show chart
- Trend queries: ALWAYS show chart
- Comparison queries: ALWAYS show chart
- Analysis queries with symbols: show chart
- Educational queries: DON'T show chart
- General queries without symbols: DON'T show chart

### 3. **Auto-Chart Decision Logging** (lines 519-526)
Added detailed logging to track auto-chart decisions:
```javascript
logger.info(`[Auto-Chart] Decision for "${originalQuery}":`, {
  intent: understanding.intent,
  symbols: understanding.symbols,
  shouldAutoChart,
  azureShowChart: result.showChart,
  finalShowChart: result.showChart || shouldAutoChart
});
```

### 4. **Fallback Logic Update** (lines 554-573)
Updated the error fallback to also use intelligent auto-chart logic.

## Testing

Created `test_auto_charts.js` with comprehensive test cases:
- "bitcoin?" → Should auto-show chart ✅
- "AAPL price" → Should auto-show chart ✅
- "how's tesla doing" → Should auto-show chart ✅
- "MSFT trend" → Should auto-show chart ✅
- "what's the market like" → Should NOT show chart (no symbols) ✅
- "explain P/E ratio" → Should NOT show chart (educational) ✅

## How to Test

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Run the auto-chart tests:
   ```bash
   node test_auto_charts.js
   ```

3. Run the comparison chart tests:
   ```bash
   node test_comparison_charts.js
   ```

## Expected Behavior

Now when users type:
- "bitcoin?" → Gets price info AND chart automatically
- "AAPL price" → Gets price info AND chart automatically
- "how's gold doing?" → Gets analysis AND chart automatically
- "explain RSI" → Gets explanation, NO chart (educational)

The system intelligently decides when to show charts based on:
1. Query intent (price, trend, comparison, analysis)
2. Presence of symbols
3. Query keywords (price, trend, performance, etc.)
4. Query format (single word with "?")

This follows the LLM-first principle where the system understands user intent and provides the most helpful response automatically.
