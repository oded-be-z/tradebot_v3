# Live API Test Report - July 23, 2025

## Executive Summary

Tested all three major features with **live data and real APIs** (no mocks). Results show partial implementation success with some critical issues that need addressing.

## Test 1: Comparison Chart Feature

**Status: ❌ FAILED - Critical Issue**

### Test Results:
- **"bitcoin vs gold"** → ❌ Intent recognized but NO symbols returned
- **"compare tesla to apple"** → ❌ Intent recognized but NO symbols returned  
- **"oil vs silver?"** → ❌ Intent recognized but NO symbols returned
- **Context-based comparison** → ❌ Failed to use context

### Key Findings:
1. ✅ **Intent Detection Works**: All queries correctly identified as `comparison_query`
2. ✅ **Chart Flag Set**: `showChart: true` for all comparison queries
3. ❌ **Missing Symbols**: Response object missing `symbols` field entirely
4. ❌ **No Chart Generation**: Without symbols, comparison charts cannot be generated

### Root Cause:
The `symbols` field is not being passed from the orchestrator response to the client response object. The fix was implemented in `dualLLMOrchestrator.js` but the field isn't making it to the final response.

### Sample Response:
```json
{
  "response": "Bitcoin and gold have long been compared as stores of value...",
  "type": "comparison_query",
  "showChart": true,
  "chartData": null
  // Missing: "symbols": ["BTC", "GOLD"]
}
```

## Test 2: Auto-Chart Logic

**Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING (70% Pass Rate)**

### Test Results:
| Query | Expected Chart | Got Chart | Result |
|-------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| "bitcoin?" | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ FAIL |
| "AAPL price" | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ PASS |
| "how's tesla doing" | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ PASS |
| "MSFT trend" | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ PASS |
| "what's the market like" | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ FAIL |
| "explain P/E ratio" | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ PASS |
| "show me gold" | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ PASS |
| "nvidia performance" | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ PASS |
| "SPY?" | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ FAIL |
| "how is amazon stock doing" | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ PASS |

### Key Findings:
1. ✅ **Price/Trend Queries Work**: Most queries with clear intent show charts
2. ❌ **Single Word + "?" Pattern**: Not consistently triggering charts ("bitcoin?", "SPY?")
3. ❌ **Over-Eager on General Queries**: "what's the market like" incorrectly showed a chart
4. ✅ **Educational Queries**: Correctly NOT showing charts for explanations

### Issues:
- The regex pattern `/^[A-Za-z]+\?$/` isn't being evaluated correctly for investment_advice intent
- General market queries are incorrectly assigned symbols (MSFT for "what's the market like")

## Test 3: Portfolio LLM-First Analysis

**Status: ❌ FAILED - Not Using LLM-First Approach**

### Test Results:
- ❌ **No Specific Numbers**: No share counts, no exact percentages
- ❌ **No Dollar Amounts**: No specific rebalancing values
- ✅ **Has Action Words**: Contains "reallocating", but generic
- ❌ **Generic Advice**: "Diversification could be a key focus"
- ❌ **No Charts**: Neither allocation nor performance charts generated

### Sample Response (Actual):
```
"Looking at your portfolio risks, it's important to ensure you're not overly concentrated in any single sector or asset class. Diversification could be a key focus here..."
```

### Expected Response (LLM-First):
```
📊 Portfolio Summary: $125,480 total, +23.5% return

⚠️ Key Risks:
• MSFT at 28.3% allocation - exceeds 25% threshold
• Tech sector 68% - highly concentrated
• TSLA volatility 3.8x market average

🎯 Immediate Actions Required:
1. Sell 8 MSFT shares (from 25 to 17) to reduce allocation to 22%
2. Sell 10 TSLA shares to reduce volatility exposure by $2,850
3. Buy 20 VTI shares ($4,000) for instant diversification

Which action would you like to execute first?
```

### Root Cause:
1. Portfolio data isn't being passed to Perplexity for analysis
2. The enhanced synthesis prompt for portfolios isn't being triggered
3. Portfolio charts aren't being generated

---

## Critical Issues Summary

### 1. **Comparison Charts - BROKEN**
- Symbols not included in response object
- Charts cannot be generated without symbols
- Intent detection works but execution fails

### 2. **Auto-Charts - PARTIALLY WORKING**
- 70% success rate
- Issues with single-word queries ending in "?"
- Some false positives on general queries

### 3. **Portfolio Analysis - NOT LLM-FIRST**
- Still using generic responses
- Not leveraging Perplexity for analysis
- No specific actionable recommendations
- No visualization charts

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Needed:

1. **Fix Symbol Passing** (Critical):
   - Ensure `symbols` field from orchestrator makes it to final response
   - Debug server.js response building

2. **Fix Auto-Chart Logic**:
   - Handle `investment_advice` intent for single-word queries
   - Prevent symbol assignment to general market queries

3. **Fix Portfolio Analysis**:
   - Ensure portfolio data reaches `fetchPortfolioAnalysis`
   - Verify enhanced synthesis prompt is used
   - Generate portfolio charts

### Verification Steps:
1. Check if `orchestratorResult.symbols` exists in server.js
2. Verify portfolio context is passed correctly
3. Debug why investment_advice intent doesn't trigger charts

## Test Environment
- **Server**: Running on port 3000
- **APIs**: Live Perplexity and Azure OpenAI
- **Data**: Real-time market data
- **No Mocks**: All tests used actual API calls

## Conclusion

While the implementation code appears correct, there are critical integration issues preventing the features from working as designed. The comparison chart feature is completely broken due to missing symbols, auto-charts work 70% of the time, and portfolio analysis is not using the LLM-first approach at all.
