## üöÄ Key Improvements Achieved

### LLM Understanding
- ‚úÖ "Who is the CEO of Apple?" ‚Üí Correctly returns Tim Cook + AAPL data
- ‚úÖ "What is inflation?" ‚Üí Educational content (not blocked)
- ‚úÖ "Market hours?" ‚Üí Trading hours information
- ‚úÖ "Apple news" ‚Üí AAPL financial news (understands context)

### Context Awareness
- ‚úÖ "Compare them" works after mentioning stocks
- ‚úÖ Multi-turn conversations maintain context
- ‚úÖ Pronouns and references resolved correctly

### Intelligence Features
- ‚úÖ No more rigid keyword matching
- ‚úÖ Understands nuance and context
- ‚úÖ Handles ambiguous queries intelligently
- ‚úÖ Future-proof for new financial terms

## üìä Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Automated Testing
```bash
# Run E2E tests
node test-e2e-complete.js

# Expected outcomes:
# - Overall pass rate > 95%
# - LLM category pass rate > 90%
# - Performance < 2s average response
```

### Phase 2: Load Testing
```bash
# Standard load test
node load-test.js

# Heavy load test  
node load-test.js --users 50 --requests 50

# Expected outcomes:
# - > 95% success rate
# - < 2s average response time
# - No memory leaks
```

### Phase 3: Manual Verification
- Complete all items in MANUAL_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md
- Focus on conversation flows
- Verify UI/UX elements
- Test edge cases manually
