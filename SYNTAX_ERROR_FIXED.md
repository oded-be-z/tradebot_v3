# ✅ SYNTAX ERROR FIXED!

## Critical Error Found and Fixed

### The Problem
**Line 1650** had a syntax error that was preventing ALL JavaScript from running:

```javascript
// WRONG - had backtick instead of closing quote
messageDiv.className = "message bot fade-in`;

// FIXED - proper closing quote
messageDiv.className = "message bot fade-in";
```

### Why This Broke Everything
- This syntax error occurred early in the JavaScript code
- JavaScript parsing stopped at this error
- No event listeners were attached
- No buttons worked
- Enter key didn't work
- Nothing could function

### The Fix
Changed the backtick (`) to a proper closing double quote (") on line 1650.

## What Should Work Now

After refreshing the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R):

1. ✅ **Send button** should respond to clicks
2. ✅ **Enter key** should send messages (not create new lines)
3. ✅ **Upload button** should open file picker
4. ✅ **All JavaScript** should load properly

## How to Test

1. **Refresh the page** to load the fixed JavaScript
2. **Open console** (F12) - should see NO syntax errors
3. **Type a message** and press Enter - should send
4. **Click send button** - should work
5. **Click upload button** - should open file dialog

## Console Output Should Show:
```
DOM Content Loaded - Setting up event listeners
Button elements found: {sendBtn: true, uploadBtn: true, chatInput: true, fileInput: true}
Send button event listener added
Upload button event listener added
Chat input event listeners added with capture phase
```

The application should now be fully functional!
