## Example Responses

### Before vs After

**Price Query**:
- Before: "Let me check that for you... Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently trading at $211.18, which represents an increase of 0.9% or $1.89 from the previous close. This positive movement suggests investor confidence in the company's AI initiatives and upcoming product launches. The stock has been showing strong momentum lately, driven by optimism around AI integration in the iPhone 16 series. Technical indicators suggest the stock might test the $215 resistance level if this momentum continues. The relative strength index (RSI) is at 62, indicating the stock still has room to run before becoming overbought. Volume has been above average, confirming the bullish sentiment. Would you like me to analyze the technical levels in more detail? Or perhaps you'd be interested in comparing AAPL with other tech giants? Let me know how you'd like to proceed!"

- After: "AAPL's at $211.18, up 0.9% today. Strong momentum from AI iPhone hype - might test $215 resistance."

**Portfolio Analysis**:
- Before: [3+ paragraphs of detailed analysis with multiple sections]
- After: "Your portfolio's up 34.95% - crushing it! Tech concentration at 70% is driving gains but risky. Consider adding 10% defensive stocks (JNJ, KO) to smooth volatility. TSLA and AAPL are your winners."
