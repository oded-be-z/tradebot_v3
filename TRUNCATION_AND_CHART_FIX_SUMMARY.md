# LLM Truncation and Chart Fix Summary

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Response Truncation - FIXED**
**Problem**: Responses were being cut off mid-sentence ("It's now over +31% ▲ of")
**Root Cause**: `max_tokens` was set to only 400 in the enhanceResponse method
**Fix Applied**: Increased `max_tokens` from 400 to 2000 in `/services/azureOpenAI.js` line 523

### 2. **Portfolio Chart Display - PARTIALLY FIXED**
**Problem**: Portfolio analysis text appears but no pie chart
**Investigation Results**:
- Chart generation IS triggered (needsChart: true)
- chartData IS included in server response
- Frontend chart rendering code is correct

**Potential Issue**: The auto-analysis in portfolio upload might not be going through the full chart generation pipeline that regular chat messages use.

## What Should Work Now

1. **Full Responses**: Portfolio analysis and all other responses should now be complete without truncation
2. **Regular Portfolio Analysis**: When typing "analyze my portfolio" in chat, charts should appear
3. **Auto-Analysis Text**: Full text analysis after portfolio upload (no truncation)

## Remaining Issue

The auto-analysis after portfolio upload may not show charts because it bypasses the normal response formatting pipeline in server.js. The regular chat endpoint goes through:
```
response → formatting → chart generation → send to client
```

But auto-analysis might be:
```
response → send directly to client (missing chart generation step)
```

## Test Instructions

1. **Test Truncation Fix**:
   - Upload portfolio
   - Check if analysis text is complete (no cut-offs)

2. **Test Chart Display**:
   - After upload, type "analyze my portfolio"
   - Check if pie chart appears with this manual request

3. **Monitor Console**:
   - Look for "[Frontend] Chart data received:" messages
   - Check if chartData is null or has actual data

The truncation issue should be completely resolved. The chart issue may require the auto-analysis to go through the same formatting pipeline as regular chat messages.
