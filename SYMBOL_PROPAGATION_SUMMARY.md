# Symbol Propagation Fix Summary

## Current Status: PARTIALLY WORKING

### What Was Done:
1. ✅ Updated `processQuery()` in dualLLMOrchestrator.js to include symbols and symbolsUsed
2. ✅ Updated `synthesizeResponse()` to preserve understanding.symbols
3. ✅ Updated server.js to extract symbols from all sources
4. ✅ Fixed error handling to preserve symbols even on error
5. ✅ Fixed scope issues with symbols variable

### Current Issue:
- The `symbols` array is NOT appearing in the final API response
- Only the single `symbol` field is present
- Type is correctly identified as `comparison_query`
- Azure correctly extracts symbols (e.g., ["BTC", "GC"])

### Root Cause:
The symbols array is being set in the response payload but is somehow not making it to the client response. This suggests either:
1. The symbols field is being filtered out somewhere
2. There's a serialization issue
3. The response is being modified after our code

### Test Results:
```
Query: "bitcoin vs gold"
Response type: comparison_query
Symbol (single): BTC
Symbols array: undefined ❌
```

### Next Steps Required:
1. Check if there's middleware filtering response fields
2. Verify the exact payload being sent by res.json()
3. Check if there's a response interceptor modifying the output
4. Consider renaming the field to avoid conflicts

### Workaround:
Currently, comparison charts are only showing data for the first symbol (BTC) instead of both symbols. The client-side code likely needs the symbols array to properly display comparison charts.
