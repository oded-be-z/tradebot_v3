For instance, if your portfolio leans heavily toward high-growth stocks, consider reallocating some funds to more defensive sectors like utilities or consumer staples. Adding some exposure to bonds or dividend-paying stocks might also help reduce volatility. Monitoring recent market trends can further guide these adjustments, as certain sectors may be poised for a rebound. Let me know if you’d like specific breakdowns or a visual analysis of your holdings.",
