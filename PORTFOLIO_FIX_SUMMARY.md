# 📊 Portfolio Formatting Fix Summary

## 🔍 Issue Identified

Portfolio responses were failing format compliance (75/100 score) because:
- Symbols like AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA were not being bolded
- The `understanding.symbols` array is empty for portfolio queries
- Portfolio symbols come from the data, not the query

## ✅ Fix Implemented

### Emergency Formatter Enhancement (server.js:3851-3862)
```javascript
// Special handling for portfolio responses
if ((understanding?.intent === 'portfolio_query' || formatted.includes('Portfolio') || formatted.includes('portfolio')) && symbols.length === 0) {
  // Extract symbols from portfolio response text
  const commonStockSymbols = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'TSLA', 'NVDA', 'META', 'BTC', 'ETH', 'SPY', 'QQQ', 'VOO', 'VTI'];
  commonStockSymbols.forEach(symbol => {
    const regex = new RegExp(`\\b${symbol}\\b(?!\\*\\*)`, 'g');
    if (regex.test(formatted)) {
      formatted = formatted.replace(regex, `**${symbol}**`);
      logger.info('[EMERGENCY-FORMAT] Added bold to portfolio symbol:', symbol);
    }
  });
}
```
